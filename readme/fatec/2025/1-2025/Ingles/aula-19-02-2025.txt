Carrer Plan:

In a few years I hope have a MVP of a kind of project (Software as a Service), and work as a university teacher. 
For that I'm learning about all kind of skills about softwares and networking (something I guess is very atractive to me), these education I'm getting reading scientific papers, documentation and at Fatec too.
The most motivational thing is that I've a family to maintain and looking for all my life I got experiences understanding that the best way to be profitable is looking for your own job and don't woriking for others (I had 3 enterprises before and I've no problem startin a new one).
Looking for career ladder I know the great challenge will be the financial and the reach for customers, but this is the point, don't give up!
Loking for goals I need a indexed incoming from work (as CLT) and I know that is only the wat to reach my true goals.
I am very focused in learning, a lot...and I know it make grow other problems in my life, like health and social problems. As a great weakness, I have a lot of problems with people, maybe a autism with comorbidities, but this is a problem to my psichiatrist.
So...about qualifications, I have 2 post graduations and I'm looking for a strictu sensu post graduation, like a master's degree.

About a checklist?
I have this one:
-learn everithing about networking and software egineering
-get a master or doctor degree
-start my labs about a SaaS (Software as a Service)
-create a lot of prototipes
-create a MVP (Minimum Viable Product)
-invest in a product
-work as a teacher after that (for love)
