Dear Claudia 
We recently interviewed three candidates for this position. 
We have decided to appoint Mrs. Lefevre, Chantal.
I will briefly describe the candidate's strengths and explain the reasons for our decision. 

In the average skills analysis we got that Mrs. Lefevre is very fit to our needs and the experience she got is clearly aligned to the role tasks. We need emphasize she has worked for a long time in countries that speak languages are Spanish and Portuguese, it may be valuable for us in this role because it leads to cultural experience with the language.

About specific points that we got:
Instead she don`t have enough experience as manager or leadership, she excelled in all other skills, even experience, even languages.

So, we highlight the Mrs. Lefevre potential to grow, this being our best bet.

Att.
