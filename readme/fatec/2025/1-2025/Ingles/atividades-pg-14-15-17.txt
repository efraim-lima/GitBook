I am pleased to say the Parent company has continued its excellent performance. We are changing, growing and doing well at a difficult time for the industry. Net profit  was €57 .2 million, an increase of 15% on last year, and share price rose by 5% to €6.4 million. 
We are a highly competitive business. We have increased our market sare to 20%. 
Consequently, our share price (?) has risen and is now at an all-time high or €9.6. 
Increased production and strong demand have had a positive effect on our cash now, so 
we arc able to finance a number or new projects. We have successfully moved to our new 
head office in central London. We are now planning to start full production at the recently 
opened Spanish subsidiary in October. 
Finally. thanks once again to our loyal and dedicated workforce .
Our employees will always be our most valuable asset.

Both companies emphasize purpose beyond profits, but Tata focuses on modernization and expansion, whereas John Lewis prioritizes employee happiness and shared success.
