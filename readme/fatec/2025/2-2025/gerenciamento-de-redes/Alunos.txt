Resposta em Inglês
To relax, I usually listen to music, because it helps me disconnect from stress and focus on positive emotions. For me, this is the most effective activity, especially when the songs have calm and relaxing tones. Another way I like to relax is by drawing or painting, since it allows me to express my creativity and forget about daily problems. Sometimes I also enjoy watching TV or browsing online, but music and art are definitely the best methods for me.
 
Tradução em Português
Para relaxar, eu normalmente escuto música, porque isso me ajuda a me desconectar do estresse e a focar em emoções positivas. Para mim, essa é a atividade mais eficaz, especialmente quando as músicas têm tons calmos e relaxantes. Outro modo que gosto de relaxar é desenhar ou pintar, já que isso me permite expressar minha criatividade e esquecer os problemas do dia a dia. Às vezes também gosto de assistir TV ou navegar online, mas a música e a arte são, sem dúvida, os melhores métodos para mim.
