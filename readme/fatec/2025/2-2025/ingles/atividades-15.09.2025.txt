I consider that any great Idea is controversial because they are disruptive and challengers for many people, they depends on thinking outside the box and most of people don't understand the kind of thing these ideas are trying to reach maybe for explaination problems or dificult activities. An example: I tried to use some tools in low code and show it to my teacher (a simple example) and he didn't understood in first time, when I tried another way and using more words and examples, and in second time the teacher understood as well as simple words for kids.

In my work I have a lot of activities with short deadlines, this make me start a workaholic behaviour every day, doing work activities every day in my work environment.
My goals are so short too and sometimes I need ignore my flexitime (because I work at home) and my work-life balance too, I guess for now, my workload is a kind of busy, but I guess in the future I'll get more quality of life and I'll can buld my own lifestyle.
