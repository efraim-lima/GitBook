I need a python code that make 40 tests assumpting 2 simmilar strings and colisions between md5 and sha1 algorythm.

For that I need that the python code do:

* create a list with 100 strings
* do a for loop that get each string in this list and do:
* run md5 criptography in both and save its hashes in a table
* run sha1 criptograthy in both and save its hashes in a table
* compare collisions between every hashes like example: string1 md5 hash against string2 md5 hash string1 md5 hash against string1 sha1 hash string1 sha1 hash against string2 sha1 hash string1 sha1 hash against string1 md5 hash etc.
* When occur any collision, please, save it as a variable and increase this variable in the table
